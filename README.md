# Temperature-Control-Project
This is the result of the assignment of the interface and microcontroller workshop course, the project aims to measure voltage, current and tempereture while controlling brightness of halogen lamp. After all measruements, the data will visualize through node red using serial communication.

Contain included:
- Schematic and PCB layout (EAGLE).
- Node red JSON source file.
- STM32G431RBTX program for sensor reading and measurement.
